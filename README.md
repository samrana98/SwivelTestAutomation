# Challenges and issues

1. Time management with the current project work was a bit hectic. Had a tight schedule.
2. Difficulties in capturing the Web locators.
3. Was interrupted by ReCaptcha since it requests a confirmation as human or not.

# Requirements: 
This is the sample automation framework for the Amazon official website with Google Chrome.
I implemented this using Java, Selenium, testNG(6.9.9),and Maven(8) with Eclipse.
